		<h5>Are Mock Tests Compulsory Before Appearing For An Actual Online Exam?</h5>
        <p>Not always, but you should consider appearing for an online mock exam as it is intended for making you familiar with the online exam platform user interface.</p>
        <p>Further, appearing for a mock test makes it possible to check whether your device and internet connection are compatible with the online exam platform or not, this can largely help to avoid last minutes issues in online examinations.</p>
        <br />

        <br />

        <h5>How To Design A Mock Test?</h5>
        <p>There are several factors that you should consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure that the students are given flexible time for appearing on the mock test.</li><br />
            <li>Make sure to mention question types in mock tests that you expect in the actual exam. For example, if an online exam would contain only subjective type questions, it is an ideal scenario to mention the subjective questions in the mock test.</li><br />
            <li>Try to give sufficient time to students to explore the platform.</li><br />
            <li>Make sure to mimic the procedure of the actual exam, for example, if the students would be required to show their ID card before they enter the online exam, the same should be the case for mock tests as well.</li><br />
